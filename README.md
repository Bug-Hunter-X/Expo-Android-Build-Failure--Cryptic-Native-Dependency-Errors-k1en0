# Expo Android Build Failure: Cryptic Native Dependency Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI.  The problem stems from misconfigured or improperly linked native dependencies within your project. The exact error message is often vague, making debugging difficult.

## Problem Description

When building your Expo app for Android, you may encounter a seemingly random build failure. The error message from the Expo CLI might be cryptic and not directly point to the source of the problem. This is often related to native modules and their dependencies not being correctly set up within the Android build environment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Clone this repository.**
2. **Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.**
3. **Attempt to build an Android APK using the Expo CLI (`expo build:android`).**

You will likely encounter a build failure with an unclear error message.

## Solution

The solution varies depending on the specific native library causing the issue.  Common causes include:

* **Incorrect native library versions:** Ensure all native dependencies are compatible with each other and the Expo SDK version.
* **Missing or incorrect build configurations:** Check your `android/app/build.gradle` file and ensure the native dependencies are correctly configured.
* **Incorrect linking:** Sometimes, native libraries might not be properly linked into the project.

The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution in the form of example steps to fix a common scenario involving a native library called 'react-native-camera'.  Refer to the documentation of your native dependencies to resolve your specific case. 

## Additional Notes

This problem can be intermittent, meaning that it might not occur every time you build the app. This adds to the difficulty in diagnosing the root cause.  Thorough checking of your native library configurations and potentially cleaning the Android build cache are recommended steps.
