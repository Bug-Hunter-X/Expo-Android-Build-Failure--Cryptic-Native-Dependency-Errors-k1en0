The solution to this problem is highly dependent on the specific native libraries and their configurations within your project. The best approach is to systematically check your `android` folder (specifically the `build.gradle` files and other build configurations) for errors. If you're using a particular native library causing the build failure (for example, `react-native-camera`), the solution may be to:

1. **Clean the build cache:** Run `expo prebuild` to reset the Android build environment.
2. **Check for library compatibility:**  Ensure the version of `react-native-camera` is compatible with your Expo SDK and other libraries.
3. **Verify correct configurations:** Inspect the configurations in `android/app/build.gradle` to confirm proper inclusion and dependency resolution of `react-native-camera`.
4. **Consider upgrading Expo:** The problem may be resolved by upgrading to a newer Expo version.

**Example using react-native-camera (replace with your actual library):**

* Verify the correct dependency is added to `package.json`
* Update Android build files to use correct versions of `react-native-camera`.
* Ensure that `react-native-camera`'s Android setup instructions are followed correctly.

Remember to carefully check the documentation of your native libraries for specific instructions.  If the issue persists, provide the complete error message from the Expo CLI and the relevant parts of your project's `android` folder for more specific assistance.
